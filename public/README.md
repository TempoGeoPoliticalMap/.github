TempoGeoPoliticalMap is an open source web application which allows users to get data for historical and/or ongoing international political events and view it in a usable way where different aspects are linked together -- temporal and spatial. This includes international organisations, military alliances, military coups, multinational military coalitions, national elections, political conferences, political crises, political murders, sources of international law, supranational unions, warfare and armed conflicts etc. WikiData is a single source of truth and hence the data source for this web application, which serves exclusively for presentation purposes to improve the UX and create additional value.
